This is a snappy blog. The idea is that it's a place where code can run in the
background but the user can be told about it in real-time.

It's still under heavy development. As of March 6, 2012, a user can create an
article in the background then be told about it.

All the non-programmer facing stuff has been moved out into lib/ or, at worst,
app/helpers.

This depends on Resque to run:

    VERBOSE=1 QUEUE=* rake environment resque:work

And on the WebSocket server:

    bundle exec ruby lib/error_forwarder/error_forwarder.rb

It works in FF and Chromium. Maybe it works elsewhere.
